In this project I developed a tool for handling and processing Html.
Such a tool can be used for various purposes, for example to implement a crawler.
A crawler (or scrapper) is a mechanism that reads websites and analyzes their Html to extract the desired information from it.
In fact, this is exactly what the Google (and other) search engine does. 
The engine scans the Internet and analyzes the Html of all websites in order to index the information so that it can retrieve it according to the search queries that the users request.
